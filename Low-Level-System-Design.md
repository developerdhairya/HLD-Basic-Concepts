# Low-Level-System-Design

## Object Oriented Programming

- Object Oriented Programming is a programming paradigm in which low level design of a software revolves around objects and classes.
- Object is anything that is state and behaviour.In OOP's, object maintains state through properies and exposes its behaviour through methods.
- A class is a blueprint for creating an object.
- An Interface is a blueprint for creating a class and used to achieve loose coupling and total abstraction.

## 4 Pillars of OOPS

### **Encapsulation**
-  Hiding internal state of an object by requiring all interactions with object to be done through publically exposed methods only.

### **Inheritence**
- A way to organise interrelated classes by making a hierarchchial structure by making subclasses extend the methods and properties of superclasses.
- `Types of Inheritence`:
  - Single Inheritence
  - Multilevel Inheritence
  - Hierarchial Inheritence
  - Multiple Inheritence `Interface Only`
  - Hybrid Inheritence `Interface Only`

*PS: Multiple/Hybrid Inheritence is not supported in java classes because of ambiguity.*
